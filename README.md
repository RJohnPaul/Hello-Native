## Welcome to my "Hello, World!" React Native app built with Expo and styled with NativeWind.

## Description

This is a minimalistic React Native application that displays the classic "Hello, World!" message on your mobile device's screen. It's an excellent starting point if you're new to React Native, Expo, or NativeWind and want to get a quick feel for how they work together.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) installed globally
- Basic knowledge of React Native and Expo
- Optionally, familiarity with NativeWind for styling

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-react-native-hello-world.git
2. Install project dependencies:

- ```bash
   npm install
  
## Usage

1. Start the Expo development server:
   ```bash
   expo start
2. Use the Expo Go app on your mobile device to scan the QR code displayed in your terminal or browser. This will open the app on your device.

3. You will see the "Hello, World!" text displayed on your mobile screen.
## Customization
Feel free to modify the app to suit your needs. You can change the text, experiment with styling using NativeWind classes, or add more components and features.
